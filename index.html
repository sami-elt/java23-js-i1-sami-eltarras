    <p>
      a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player
      decides to "hold": If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it
      becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it
      is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. If a player
      chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it
      becomes the next player's turn. The first player to score 100 or more
      points wins.
